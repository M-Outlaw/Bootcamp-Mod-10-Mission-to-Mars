# Bootcamp-Mod-10-Mission-to-Mars
Performing web scraping to gather information to create a website and then using Bootstrap 3 components to make it look professional.

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis was to use web scraping tools to gather information about Mars to help Robin, a junior data scientist, create a website in hopes of getting the attention of NASA to possibly get a job there someday.

### Process
- First, jupyter notebook was used to pull the data since it is easy to double check that the correct information is being scrapped.
- Then, the code was downloaded as a python file and linked with a HTML file to be able to use flask to create the website.

### Data
- The latest new article about Mars from the website https://redplanetscience.com.
- An image of Mars from https://spaceimages-mars.com.
- Facts about Mars scrapped as a table using Mongo from https://galaxyfacts-mars.com/.
- Images of Mars' hemispheres from https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/results?q=hemisphere+enhanced&k1=target&v1=Mars.


### Extras
- The goal was to make the website dynamic so that it can always have the most up to date data. To do this, a button was incorporated to run the scraping script and gather all of the same information, but the latest version of the data if it had been updated.
- Used Bootstrap 3 to make the website look mor professional.
  * Used Bootstrap's grid system.
  * Made the website mobile responsive.
  * Added formatting to the table.
  * Added dividers for the data on the page.
  * Centered all headers
  * Added an image to the header.
